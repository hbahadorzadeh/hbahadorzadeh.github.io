  details: |
    I was a backend developer with a strong knowledge of Linux administration.
    I've changed my path about three years ago and started working as devops
    engineer. I have more than 9 years experience in these fields and most of
    that time was in Iran's top IT companies. I'm passionate for learning new
    techs and more passionate for developing them.
