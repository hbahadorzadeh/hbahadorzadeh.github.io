## Hello

I'm Hamed Bahadorzadeh — a Senior Platform and Distributed Systems Engineer based in Almere, Netherlands.

After 10+ years building developer platforms, CI/CD systems, and distributed data infrastructure, I decided it was time to put my thoughts somewhere public.

## What I'll Write About

This blog will focus on topics I work with day-to-day:

- **Platform Engineering** — internal developer platforms, Kubernetes controllers, CI/CD systems at scale
- **Distributed Systems** — Kafka, Spark, Elasticsearch, event-driven architectures
- **Go** — practical patterns for building platform tooling and Kubernetes operators
- **AI in Engineering** — using LLMs to augment developer workflows (based on real production experience)
- **Operational lessons** — things I've learned running systems at high throughput and strict SLAs

## Background

My current role at Flow Traders involves maintaining a platform that supports 10,000+ CI/CD pipelines across multiple language ecosystems and building AI-powered tools that make engineers more productive. Before that, I led DevOps for ~200 microservices at Kian Digital and built a SIEM platform processing 100,000 security events per second at Amnafzar.

I'll be writing about real problems I've solved and patterns that have worked (and some that haven't).
